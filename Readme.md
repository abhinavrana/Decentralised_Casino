# This project is under development.

Idea is to create a decentralized lottery game and a roulette game.

Things completed till now:
1. Solidity smart contract for lottery is 80% completed, needs some refinements.
2. UI for roulette is already in place.

Things to be done in future:
1. Complete smart contract for lottery.
2. Complete smart contract for roulette for:
- Straight/Single => Bet on a single number
- Split => Bet on two vertically/horizontally adjacent numbers
3. UI for lottery game.

PR are welcome for improvements.
